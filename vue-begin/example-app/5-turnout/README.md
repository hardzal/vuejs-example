# Challenge

Create an attendance “count” on each event card that keeps track of the number of users planning to go to an event.

Create a like/dislike voting system to keep track of popular events.

Integrate an API like the EventBrite api to load a list of real public events.

Run npm run build in the terminal directory of your project, to create a build folder. Then host the project online!
